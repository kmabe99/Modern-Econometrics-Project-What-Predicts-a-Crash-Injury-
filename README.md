# Modern-Econometrics-Project-What-Predicts-a-Crash-Injury-
This project cleans and analyzes Maryland’s Crash Reporting – Drivers dataset (2015-2025) to identify factors that raise the likelihood of driver injury. Using tidyverse in R, I engineer key features—vehicle age, weather, posted speed (plus a squared term to capture non-linearity), driver distraction, and an interaction between distraction and vehicle age—then estimate baseline and extended logistic-regression models. Results show injury odds climb with higher speed limits, older vehicles, and adverse weather, while newer-car safety technology appears to offset some distraction risk. The repo contains the full ETL pipeline, exploratory plots, model code, and a brief write-up, offering a reproducible template for crash-injury analytics and policy insight.
